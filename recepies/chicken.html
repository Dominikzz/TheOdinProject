    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the chorizo over a medium heat in a large saucepan or flameproof
            casserole dish for 5 mins or until it releases its oil and starts
            to char at the edges. Add the onion and fry for 5 mins more or until soft.
            Tip in the garlic and cook for 2 mins before stirring in the paprika
            and sundried tomatoes. Add the chicken thighs and fry for 2 mins each
            side until they are well coated in the spices and beginning to brown.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chopped tomatoes and stock, and turn the heat down.
            Cover and cook for 40 mins until the chicken is falling apart and 
            the sauce is thick. Stir the lemon juice through. Serve by piling 
            spoonfuls of the ragu into hot jacket potatoes with parsley sprinkled over 
            and a dollop of soured cream, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
